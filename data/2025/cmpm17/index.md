This course is designed to cover the common categories often seen in CTFs.
We will cover the following topics:

- **Steganography**: Hiding data in plain sight
- **Web Exploitation**: SQL injection, XSS, CSRF
- **Real-life Hacking**: CVEs, 0-days

And additional supplementary hacking topics!

This course provides a great hands-on experience for those interested in cybersecurity to explore what hacking is all about. **By completing this course, you will earn 3 units of credit and fulfill the PR-E GE requirement.**

Because this course is geared towards those who have no experience, we are restricted to enrolling only first and second year students by credit count.
We understand some students may have higher amounts of credits but are still interested in the course. [If you currently have junior or senior standing, please fill out the form below and we will consider you for the course.](https://forms.gle/UjGFRQDbKjJUZBa78)

Due to the hands-on design of this course, we can only accommodate 20 students in total (as of now). There are 15 seats open for general enrollment, and 5 seats reserved for club members. If you are able to enroll normally, we recommend doing that or joining the waitlist on myUCSC if the course fills up before you are able to enroll.
