We’re excited to announce an incredible opportunity for select Slug Security members who want to learn foundational cyber skills, test their knowledge, and boost their resumes by earning an industry certification. We’re offering a limited number of INE’s eJPT certifications, fully funded by Slug Security, to those who show strong interest in cybersecurity.

If you’re interested, please fill out the [Google form](forms.gle/ZzdNcWfMfenGAs5H8) (UCSC SSO) and feel free to reach out to us (via [mailto:slugsec@ucsc.edu](slugsec@ucsc.edu)) if you have any questions about the program.

!!! Question "FAQs"
	To keep things rolling, we will be closing the application on Friday, Febuary 28th, 2025 at midnight.

    We've only got a handful of certificates available, so make sure you put thought into your application - you're competing against others for a spot!

Certificates such as INE’s eJPT provide a structured way to learn specialized skills through focused courses and exams. Certification exams can range from multiple-choice questions to full virtual environments where you must demonstrate your skills hands-on. This pathway gives students a chance to gain industry-relevant experience when the job market might not offer it. At UCSC, where there isn’t a dedicated Cybersecurity degree, certifications can bridge a technical major (like Computer Science) with hands-on cybersecurity experience.

The eJPT is an entry-level certification intended for those with minimal or no prior cybersecurity background. However, if you succeed with eJPT, it can open the door to Slug Security covering more advanced certifications like Offensive Security’s OSCP (at an outrageous $1800), which is highly recognized and sought after in the field.
